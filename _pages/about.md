I am an MSc. student studying Computer Engineering under the supervision of Dr. [Karteek Popuri](https://diaglab.cs.mun.ca/team/), Prof. Lihong Zhang, and Dr. Telex Ngatched at [Memorial University of Newfoundland](https://www.mun.ca) in the Department of Engineering and Applied Science. My research is on Medical Image Analysis.
I am generally interested in problems where deep learning algorithms can be applied and make breakthroughs.
